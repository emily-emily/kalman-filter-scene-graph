Return a scene graph for this image in a JSON format. You must adhere to
the following rules:
1. Do not include any additional text.
2. Use this JSON format:
{
    "objects": {
        "object_id1": {
            "category": <object_category_id>,
            "bounding_box": [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax],
            "attributes": [<attr_id1>, <attr_id2>]
        },
        ...
    },
    "relations": [
        ["object_id1", "object_id2", <relation_id>],
        ...
    ]
}
3. You may create object_ids by using a word or short phrase to describe
the object with a number, joined by underscores (eg. "book_1"). Object ids
must be unique.
4. The bounding box coordinates must be accurate.
5. object_category_id, attr_id1, and relation_id must refer to the ids
given in the id bank under the objects, attributes, and relations sections
respectively. All ids must correspond to a valid id in the given id bank
and accurately describe the object, attribute, or relation in the image.
6. object_ids in relations must reference a valid object in "objects".
7. Do not include trailing commas.
